Hi

I am applying for your job working on an Exadata Cloud Service using my advanced PL/SQL programming skills. I have a 2:1 from Imperial College London in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. I have nearly 30 years of Oracle experience and best practice from Oracle 5 onwards (not much 12c/18 exposure) and I looking to get back into commercial data engineering after working for Imperial College London since 2002.

My SQL and PL/SQL development experience is as follows:
 
* Creating classic business logic in Oracle forms 3/4.5 both internal and in database packages;
* PL/SQL package management: replacing changed packages;
* Support for data loading using a sophisticated XML driven bespoke pipeline. This included the AES256 encryption of addresses and NHS numbers and replacement with cryptographic checksums. The encryption was a PL/SQL package which called a C library via extproc. Other packages cleaned postcodes, dates and addresses and provided address matching to extract building co-ordinates. Packages were also provided to re-organise, partition and index the data and included support for partition exchange. The pipeline supported tables up to 250GB in size; 
* HTML Metadata tools (using htmldb/PHP - a precursor of Apex) to extract and display data dictionary metadata, data reports (e.g. annual counts, nullity). This was fully integrated with the data loading pipeline. XML was also supported in the same toolchain so that HTML and PDF outputs could also be provided. In recent years I have also carried out graphical and geospatial data processing and outputs using leaflet.js/d3.js and Java GeoTools; 

I have commercial development experience including full lifecycle experience and in the automation of build, integration and testing. I am interested in complimenting this with Agile experience.

I have good relational design skills, originally in Oracle CASE which was used to auto generate the forms, menus and reports. I also have extensive DBA experience and am interested Partitioning, tuning and DML/DDL parallelisation. My design experience is up to date since my current 
project started out on Oracle before being ported to Postgres and SQL Server. The design in available online at: https://rawgit.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility/master/rifDatabase/ERD/rif40/index-sahsuland-postgres8.html

I would be interested in updating my APEX skills and utilising the awesome power of Exadata in the cloud.
Many thanks for your time

Peter Hambly
